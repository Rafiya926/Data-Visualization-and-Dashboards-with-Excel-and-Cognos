Introduction to Charts
We'll give an overview of several different types of charts and visualizations and discuss how they can be used to tell a story.
Let's begin by looking at a line chart when comparing different but related datasets.
Line chart
A line chart is a great way to display the information. They are able to display trends and show how a data value is changing in 
relation to a continuous variable. 
For example, if time is a continuous variable, how has the sale of a product or multiple products changed? 

Pie charts
This type of chart can show the breakdown of an entity into its sub-parts and the proportion of
the subparts in relation to one another. Each portion of the pie represents a static value or category, and the sum of all categories 
is equal to a 100 percent.
In this example, we have a Marketing Campaign with four distinct categories. Social Sites, Native Advertising, 
Paid Influencers, and Live Events. With this type of data representation, we can easily see the total number of leads generated per 
category. We now look at one of the most commonly used charts.

The Bar Chart
This type of chart is the most common as they are easy to create and are great for comparing related data sets or parts of a whole.
For example, in this bar chart, we can see the population numbers of different countries and how they compare to one another.
We can also use stacked bars in which each bar is divided into sub bars that are stacked end to end. In this stacked bar, 
we can see the population of each country split into four age ranges. 
Would you like the graph to appear vertical and not horizontal? Then column charts would be a great pick. This type of chart can be used 
quite effectively to show change over time and to compare values side-by-side. For example, showing page views versus user's session 
time on a website as it changes on a month-to-month basis. While this type of chart looks similar to a bar chart, they cannot always 
be used interchangeably. For example, a column chart may be better suited for showing negative and positive values.

Treemaps
which are useful for displaying complex hierarchies using nested rectangles. In this example, 
the treemap depicts statewide employment rates within the population of a country over the last year. The size of the rectangle 
represents the population and the color represents the employment rate. We can click on any region to see the employment data of
the sub-regions within the selected region. Trying to display a pipeline or different stages of a continuous process.

Funnel charts 
In this example, the funnel chart is showing the conversion rate at each stage of the sales process from
lead generation to the final sale. 

Another exceptional chart is the scatter chart. In this type of chart, the circle colors represent the categories of data and 
the circle sizes are indicative of the volume of data.
For example, in this scatter chart, we can see each product line by the number of units sold and the revenue it brings. 
A scatter chart can be great for revealing trends, clusters, patterns, and correlations between data points. 

Bubble charts This is a variant of scatter charts, and they are useful for comparing a handful of categories to one
another in terms of relative significance. 
For example, understanding areas of significant expenditure in an organization's sales budgets.

Lastly, we have sparklines
Sparklines do not include an axis or coordinates, yet they display trends simply and effectively. These are great for showing the 
general trend of a variation.
For example, stock market price fluctuations from the opening to the closing of a trading day. We learned about the 
importance of charts and how they are able to shape our data to provide meaningful information. We will dive into
more details about how to create and configure different types of charts in Excel.


we’ll look at how to create a few basic types of charts in Excel. We’ll first create line charts, then pie charts, and lastly, 
bar charts.

First let’s start with line charts. A line chart is a type of graph, used to show information as a series of data points
connected by straight lines. In a line chart, the horizontal axis typically represents time or a similar category, 
and the vertical axis typically represents numerical values. Because line charts can display continuous data over a given time period, 
they're perfect for showing trends in data at equal time intervals, such as days, months, quarters, or years. Line charts are ideal 
for scenarios where you have data that’s arranged in columns or rows, or where your data contains multiple data series. 
On the car_sales worksheet of the Car Sales workbook, let’s first filter the data to display only Ford car models.

Now let’s create a line chart with this data. We’ll select the data from 2 non-adjacent columns, in this case “Model” and “Price”.
Then we select Line chart from the 2-D Line category of the Charts group.

Let’s change the chart title to “Price of Ford Cars”, which we can do by simply double-clicking the chart title textbox, and
editing the text. We now see a floating chart area containing our line chart, which displays the price trend of Ford cars across 
its models. Let’s move this line chart to the left side of the worksheet below our data.

OK, now let’s move on to pie charts. A pie chart is a type of circular graph, used to show the relative contribution of different 
categories (which we see as slices), to make an overall total (which we see as a pie). Data points on a pie chart, that is, the slices, 
are represented as percentages of the complete pie. Pie charts provide a very simple visualization of differing data results, 
which we humans find very easy to comprehend. Pie charts are best used when you only have one data series, and when your data 
contains no more than maybe a dozen categories, otherwise the pie chart can start to look too busy and become difficult to read. 
For the pie chart, we’ll use the model names manufactured by Ford along with their unit sales.

To create our pie chart, we’ll select the data from 2 non-adjacent columns; in this case, “Model” and “Unit Sales”. 
Then we select Pie chart from 2-D Pie category of the Charts group. The new floating chart area contains our pie chart,
which displays the relative contribution of unit sales from individual Ford car models, which are the ‘slices’ of the pie,
and they combine together to make an overall total of unit sales of Ford cars, which is the whole ‘pie’. 
Let’s change the chart style to customize the look of the pie chart. There are numerous styles to choose from in the gallery 
and you can even make combinations of multiple styles; for example, here we’ve chosen style 3 and style 7, which gives us the 
percentage values displayed in each slice, and a nice dark contrasting background color. Let’s again move the chart, this time 
to the center of the worksheet below our data.

Lastly, let’s have a look at bar charts. A bar chart is a type of graph used to compare values across categories either 
using horizontal bars, or vertical bars in the case of column charts, which are a variety of bar charts. In a bar chart, 
the categories are usually arranged on the vertical axis, and the values are on the horizontal axis. Whereas, in a column chart, 
the categories are typically arranged on the horizontal axis, and the values are displayed on the vertical axis. 
To create our bar chart, we’ll select the data from 2 non-adjacent columns; in this case “Model” and “Retention %”.
Then we select a style of bar chart from the 2-D Bar category of Bar Charts.

The new floating chart area contains our bar chart, which displays comparative values for the retention percentage of the 
different Ford models using horizontal bars. Again, we can change the chart color to customize the look of the bar chart. 
If you just want to choose a color scheme based on a palette of colors, rather than a style, you can click the Change Colors 
button and then select a color palette from the list.

we learned how to create, line, pie, and bar charts in Excel.Next we’ll look at how to use the PivotChart feature in Excel.
